The repository contains code for the solution methods presented in the following paper:

ADD PAPER

The following methods are covered:

- Bilinear formulation to generate weak counterfactual explanations
- Bilinear formulation to generate strong counterfactual explanations
- Bilinear formulation to generate relative counterfactual explanations
- Linearized (and hence convex) version of the formulation for relative counterfactual explanations
