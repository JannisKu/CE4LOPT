Solution methods for counterfactual explanations for linear optimization problems.

The repository contains code for the solution methods presented in the following paper:

Kurtz J., Birbil S.I., den Hertog D. (2024). Counterfactual Explanations for Linear Optimization. arxiv preprint

Code: 
The following methods are covered:
- Bilinear formulation to generate weak counterfactual explanations
- Bilinear formulation to generate strong counterfactual explanations
- Bilinear formulation to generate relative counterfactual explanations
- Linearized (and hence convex) version of the formulation for relative counterfactual explanations

Instances:
- Syrian dataset for experiments on the diet problem
- CE Setups for the experiments on the NETLIB instances.
- The NETLIB instances used are from: https://www.netlib.org/
